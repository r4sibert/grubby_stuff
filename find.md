## find

### Does what it says.

* Find all files by extension in the current working directory:
  > find . -type f -name "*.some_extension"

  Where "." indicates "current directory", "-type f" indicates a
  regular file type, "-name" defines the base of the file name, and the "*.some_extension" tells bash that it's looking for any file with some_extension.

* Some other useful thing
